# Story 1.4: Auto Campaign Dashboard & Creation System

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Store Owner/Merchant,
**I want** to create and manage automated pricing campaigns through an intuitive dashboard interface,
**so that** I can set up intelligent pricing rules that automatically adjust prices based on inventory changes without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Campaign Creation Interface
   - Campaign creation form with name, description, and rule configuration
   - Pricing rule builder with when/then logic (inventory conditions → pricing actions)
   - Product targeting with Shopify resource picker integration
   - Form validation for rule logic and numeric inputs
   - Draft/preview mode before activation

2. Campaign Dashboard
   - List view of all campaigns with status indicators (Draft, Active, Paused, Completed)
   - Campaign cards showing key metrics (trigger count, last triggered, affected products)
   - Real-time status updates via WebSocket/polling
   - Search and filter capabilities by status and date ranges

3. Campaign Management
   - Individual campaign detail pages with full configuration view
   - Activate/pause/deactivate campaign controls
   - Edit campaign rules and targeting (for draft campaigns only)
   - Delete campaigns with confirmation dialogs

4. Campaign Monitoring
   - Real-time webhook processing status indicators
   - Campaign trigger history and frequency tracking
   - Affected products count and recent price changes
   - Performance metrics dashboard

5. Campaign Rollback System
   - Rollback functionality to restore original prices
   - Rollback job creation and progress tracking
   - Audit trail integration for rollback verification
   - Confirmation workflows for destructive actions

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
Based on architecture documents analysis:

**Frontend Architecture (Remix Routes)**:
- `app/routes/app.campaigns._index.tsx` - Campaign dashboard main page
- `app/routes/app.campaigns.create.tsx` - Campaign creation interface 
- `app/routes/app.campaigns.$id.tsx` - Individual campaign management page
- `app/routes/api/campaigns.tsx` - Campaign CRUD API endpoints
- `app/routes/api/campaigns.$id.tsx` - Individual campaign API operations
- `app/routes/api/campaigns.$id.rollback.tsx` - Campaign rollback API endpoint

**Backend Service Architecture**:
- `app/services/campaign-service.server.ts` - Core campaign business logic
- `app/models/campaign.server.ts` - Campaign database repository pattern
- `app/services/audit-logger.server.ts` - Audit trail logging for campaign changes
- `app/lib/auth.server.ts` - Authentication middleware and permission checks

**Database Models** (from docs/architecture/data-models.md):
- Campaign model with fields: id, name, description, status, targetProducts, triggerCount, lastTriggered
- PricingRule model with when/then logic: whenCondition, whenValue, thenAction, thenMode, thenValue
- AuditTrailEntry model for change tracking: entityType, entityId, changeType, triggerReason

**Component Architecture**:
- Campaign Engine: Core automation processing with webhook integration
- Frontend App: React-based UI with Remix routing and Polaris components
- Webhook Service: Real-time Shopify inventory change processing

**Key Integration Points**:
- Shopify Admin API for product data and resource picker integration
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM for campaign and audit data persistence  
- Redis for caching and real-time update management
- Webhook processing for inventory change triggers

**Authentication & Permissions**:
- Shopify OAuth integration via authenticate.admin() middleware
- Permission checks for campaign management: `write_products`, `write_inventory` scopes required
- Shop owner verification for rollback operations

**Campaign Workflow Logic**:
- Manual Campaign Creation → Rule Configuration → Product Targeting → Activation
- Automated Webhook Processing → Rule Evaluation → Price Updates → Audit Logging
- Campaign Monitoring → Real-time Status → Performance Tracking
- Rollback Processing → Audit Trail Analysis → Price Restoration

### Testing
**Test File Locations**: 
- Frontend: `tests/unit/components/campaigns/` and `tests/integration/routes/`
- Backend: `tests/unit/services/` and `tests/integration/api/`
- E2E: `tests/e2e/campaign-lifecycle.spec.ts`

**Testing Standards**:
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest for both frontend components and backend services
- **Component Testing**: @testing-library/react for user interaction simulation
- **API Testing**: Supertest with @remix-run/testing for route testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for complete workflow validation
- **Database Testing**: Test database setup/cleanup with transaction isolation

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**:
- Mock Shopify API responses using vi.mock() for predictable testing
- Test database with setupTestDatabase() and cleanupTestDatabase() utilities
- Component props mocking for isolated unit test scenarios
- Webhook simulation for campaign trigger testing
- Authentication mocking with createTestSession() utility

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Campaign form validation testing with invalid rule combinations
- Real-time dashboard update testing with mock WebSocket/polling
- Rollback functionality testing with audit trail integration
- Permission-based access testing for different user roles
- Campaign lifecycle E2E testing from creation through rollback
