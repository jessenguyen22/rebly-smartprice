# Story 1.3: Enhanced Create Pricing Job Page

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** store owner,
**I want** an improved interface for immediate pricing changes with better organization and reusability,
**so that** I can efficiently execute manual pricing jobs and prepare templates for future automation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Enhanced UI organization of existing admin.tsx functionality using improved Polaris layouts
2. Job naming capability: "Black Friday Prep Job" with save/load job templates
3. Improved results table with export options (CSV/PDF) and detailed change summaries
4. "Save as Template" functionality for reusing pricing rule configurations
5. Integration hint: "Convert to Auto Campaign" button (disabled with "Coming Soon" tooltip)
