# Story 1.1: Database Foundation & Enhanced Audit Trail

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** store owner,  
**I want** complete tracking of all pricing changes with detailed audit trails,  
**so that** I can maintain compliance, understand pricing history, and have confidence in pricing decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. PostgreSQL database replaces SQLite for session storage and adds campaign/audit tables
2. Every pricing change (manual or automated) creates audit trail record with timestamp, old/new price, trigger reason
3. Pricing job results table includes audit trail references and export capabilities
4. Database migration preserves all existing session data without disruption
5. Enhanced results display shows job IDs, execution time, and detailed change tracking

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: All existing admin.tsx pricing functionality works identically with PostgreSQL backend
- **IV2**: Session management and Shopify authentication remain completely functional
- **IV3**: Performance testing confirms no degradation with audit trail recording during high-volume changes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist (this is story 1.1).

### Data Models
**Complete database schema defined** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:

- **audit_trail_entries**: Core table for compliance tracking with entity_type, entity_id, change_type, old_value, new_value, trigger_reason, timestamp, and metadata JSONB
- **campaigns**: Campaign management with UUID primary key, status enum, target_products array, trigger tracking
- **pricing_rules**: Conditional logic for both campaigns and manual jobs with when/then pattern
- **pricing_jobs**: Manual pricing operations with type enum, status tracking, bulk operation support
- **processing_results**: Individual variant results with audit trail references
- **sessions**: Migrated session storage maintaining existing functionality
- **webhook_logs**: Reliability tracking with payload storage and processing status

**Key TypeScript interfaces** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
interface AuditTrailEntry {
  id: string;
  entityType: 'variant' | 'product';
  changeType: 'price_update' | 'compare_at_update' | 'inventory_sync';
  oldValue: string;
  newValue: string;
  triggerReason: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface ProcessingResult {
  id: string;
  variantId: string;
  success: boolean;
  auditTrailId?: string;
  // ... existing result fields
}
```

### API Specifications
**Database operations use repository pattern** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:

- **CampaignRepository**: CRUD operations in `app/models/campaign.server.ts`
- **AuditRepository**: Audit trail management in `app/models/audit.server.ts`  
- **PricingJobRepository**: Job management in `app/models/pricing-job.server.ts`

**Authentication preserved** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Continue using `authenticate.admin(request)` from existing `app/shopify.server.ts`
- Session storage migrated but authentication flow unchanged
