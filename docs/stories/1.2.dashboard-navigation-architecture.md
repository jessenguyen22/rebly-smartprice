  completedAt?: Date;
}
```

**System Health Monitoring** [Source: architecture/components.md]:

### API Specifications
**Dashboard Data Loading** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use existing repository pattern for consistent data access
- Loader functions in Remix routes for server-side data fetching
- Error boundaries for graceful database connection failure handling

**Navigation Preservation** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
- Continue using Shopify App Bridge NavMenu component from existing `app/routes/app.tsx`
- Maintain existing authentication patterns with `authenticate.admin(request)`
- Preserve Polaris component usage and styling consistency

### Component Specifications
**Dashboard Layout** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]:
```typescript
// app/routes/app._index.tsx - Dashboard component structure
import { Page, Layout, Card, BlockStack, Text, Button } from '@shopify/polaris';
import { TitleBar } from "@shopify/app-bridge-react";

interface DashboardProps {
  recentJobs: PricingJob[];
  activeCampaigns: Campaign[];
  systemHealth: SystemHealth;
}

export default function Dashboard({ recentJobs, activeCampaigns, systemHealth }: DashboardProps) {
  return (
    <Page>
      <TitleBar title="Pricing Dashboard" />
      <Layout>
        <Layout.Section>
          <Card title="Recent Pricing Jobs">
            {/* Recent jobs display */}
          </Card>
        </Layout.Section>
        <Layout.Section secondary>
          <Card title="Active Campaigns">
            {/* Campaign status display */}
          </Card>
        </Layout.Section>
      </Layout>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

## Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements (v1.1)

### Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Problem**: Users encountering "FATAL: sorry, too many clients already" errors during dashboard loading and pricing job operations.

**Root Cause**: Multiple simultaneous database connections without proper connection pooling configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented connection pooling in `app/db.server.ts` with `connection_limit=5` and `pool_timeout=10`
- Created DatabaseManager pattern in `app/models/database-manager.server.ts` for centralized connection management
- Updated dashboard loader to use sequential database calls instead of parallel Promise.all()

**Files Modified**: `app/db.server.ts`, `app/models/database-manager.server.ts`, `app/routes/app._index.tsx`

### Dashboard Data Separation Issues
**Problem**: "Recent Pricing Jobs" table empty, "Active Campaigns" showing manual pricing jobs instead of real automation campaigns.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient filtering logic to separate manual job tracking records from actual automation campaigns.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced DatabaseManager with sophisticated campaign filtering logic
- Manual pricing jobs now only create PricingJob records, not Campaign records
- Active Campaigns section now filters out campaigns created for bulk operations
- Jobs Today calculation fixed to count actual PricingJob records

**Files Modified**: `app/models/database-manager.server.ts`, `app/routes/app.pricing-job.tsx`, `app/routes/app._index.tsx`

### Duplicate PricingJob Creation
**Problem**: Creating single pricing job resulted in multiple duplicate records in database.

**Root Cause**: Two separate PricingJob creation calls in the same workflow.

**Solution**:
- Removed redundant PricingJob creation from early workflow stage
- Consolidated to single PricingJob creation with complete variant data collection
- Enhanced with proper status tracking (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED)

**Files Modified**: `app/routes/app.pricing-job.tsx`

### Success Rate Display Issues
**Problem**: Recent Pricing Jobs table showing 0% success rate even for successful operations.

**Root Cause**: `successCount` not being properly updated in database during job completion.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `updateStatus()` method in PricingJobRepository to accept counts parameter
- Updated pricing job completion logic to pass `{ successCount, totalVariants }` to database
- Dashboard now displays accurate success rates calculated from database values

**Files Modified**: `app/routes/app.pricing-job.tsx`

### User Experience Improvements
**Problem**: Lack of feedback when pricing jobs complete or when variants don't meet rule conditions.

**Solution**:
- Added toast notifications for job completion (success/failure/partial success)
- Enhanced result banners to clearly show skipped variants with reasons
- Improved status badges and messaging throughout the workflow

**Files Modified**: `app/routes/app.pricing-job.tsx`

### Testing and Validation
- Database inspection scripts created for debugging data issues
- Cleanup utilities implemented for removing test/duplicate records
- Connection pooling tested under load to prevent regression

**Scripts Added**: `scripts/check-dashboard-data.js`, `scripts/cleanup-abc-records.js`
