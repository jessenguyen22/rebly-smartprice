# Story 1.8: Enterprise Rule Execution Engine - Anti-Oscillation System

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Production Ready

## Story

**As a** Store Owner/Merchant,  
**I want** my automated pricing campaigns to execute rules precisely once per threshold crossing without oscillation,  
**So that** inventory changes don't cause pricing spirals and my customers experience predictable, stable pricing behavior.

## Story Context

**Critical Business Problem:**
- **Issue**: Rule re-triggering oscillation causing pricing spiral (inventory 19→18 triggers repeated price increases)
- **Impact**: Customer confusion, pricing instability, potential revenue loss from erratic price behavior
- **Root Cause**: Simple threshold evaluation without state management allows rules to re-trigger on every inventory change
- **Business Risk**: Enterprise clients expect Fortune 500-grade pricing stability and predictability

**Enterprise Solution Integration:**
- **Integrates with**: Campaign processing service, Shopify webhook handlers, pricing rule evaluation system
- **Technology**: State machine-based rule execution, PostgreSQL with comprehensive audit trails, threshold crossing detection
- **Follows pattern**: Financial trading systems and major e-commerce platforms anti-oscillation techniques
- **Touch points**: All automated pricing workflows, webhook processing, campaign rule evaluation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **State-Based Rule Execution**: Rules operate through defined states (INACTIVE → TRIGGERED → RESET_PENDING) preventing re-triggering
2. **Threshold Crossing Detection**: Rules only trigger when crossing thresholds, not on every condition evaluation
3. **Hysteresis Support**: Different thresholds for trigger vs reset to prevent oscillation at boundaries
4. **Multi-Product Stability**: System handles campaigns with multiple products without performance degradation

### Enterprise Requirements

5. **Processing Locks**: Concurrent webhook processing prevented through database-level locking mechanisms
6. **Price Cooldowns**: Rate limiting prevents excessive price changes within defined time windows
7. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Complete state history tracking for regulatory compliance and debugging
8. **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second rule evaluation even with complex multi-product campaigns

### Quality Requirements

9. **Zero Oscillation Guarantee**: Mathematical proof that rules cannot re-trigger until reset conditions met
10. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing campaigns continue working without modification
11. **Graceful Error Handling**: System degrades gracefully with detailed error logging and fallback mechanisms
12. **Production Monitoring**: Full observability with structured logging and performance metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Enterprise Rule Execution Engine

**Core Innovation: Threshold Crossing Detection**
```typescript
// Prevents oscillation by detecting actual threshold crossings
private static async evaluateThresholdCrossing(
  context: RuleEvaluationContext,
  executionState: any
): Promise<ThresholdCrossingResult>
```

**State Machine Implementation**
- **INACTIVE**: Rule ready for initial trigger
- **TRIGGERED**: Rule executed, awaiting reset condition
- **RESET_PENDING**: Reset condition met, ready for next crossing
- **COOLING_DOWN**: Rate limiting active

**Database Schema Enhancement**
```sql
-- Core state tracking
rule_execution_states (variantId, ruleId, state, triggerCount, lastTriggerValue)
-- Complete audit trail
variant_state_history (inventoryChange, priceChange, changeReason)
-- Concurrency control
processing_locks (resourceId, lockType, acquiredAt)
-- Rate limiting
price_cooldowns (variantId, cooldownUntil)
```

### Integration Points

**Campaign Processing Service**
```typescript
// Replace simple evaluation with enterprise logic
const shouldExecute = await EnterpriseRuleExecutionEngine.shouldExecuteRule({
  rule, campaign, currentState, previousState
});
```

**Webhook Processing**
```typescript
// State capture on every inventory/price change
await EnterpriseRuleExecutionEngine.captureVariantState(
  variantId, productId, inventoryQuantity, priceAmount, shopId, 'webhook_update'
);
```

## Business Impact

### Problem Solved
- **Before**: Inventory 19→18 caused repeated rule triggers and pricing spiral
- **After**: Single trigger per threshold crossing with stable pricing behavior
- **Validation**: Multi-product campaigns tested successfully without oscillation
