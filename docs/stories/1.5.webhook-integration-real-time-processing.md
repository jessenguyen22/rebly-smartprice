## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** Store Owner/Merchant,
**I want** my campaigns t**Task 2 COMPLETED** - Real-Time Campaign Processing Engine ✅

**Major Achievements:**
- **CampaignProcessingService**: Complete service for processing inventory webhooks and triggering campaigns
- **Campaign Rule Evaluation**: Real-time evaluation of campaign rules against webhook inventory data
- **Batch Processing**: 5 variants per batch with proper rate limiting and error handling
- **Campaign Integration**: Service connects PubSubWebhookService with campaign processing logic
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all campaign-triggered price changes
- **Session Integration**: Service to register admin clients for campaign processing context

**Key Technical Implementation:**
- **Service Architecture**: `CampaignProcessingService` evaluates active campaigns against webhook data
- **Webhook Integration**: `CampaignWebhookIntegrationService` bridges webhook processing and campaign execution
- **Session Management**: `CampaignSessionIntegrationService` handles admin client registration
- **Rule Processing**: Supports all existing rule types (less_than_abs, more_than_abs, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and non-blocking audit failures
- **Performance**: Batch processing with 100ms delays between batches

**Campaign Processing Flow:**
1. Webhook received → `PubSubWebhookService.processWebhookMessage()`
2. Campaign integration → `CampaignWebhookIntegrationService.processWebhookForCampaigns()`
3. Active campaigns → `CampaignProcessingService.processInventoryWebhook()`
4. Rule evaluation → Individual rule processing against inventory data
5. Price updates → Shopify GraphQL API with batch processing
6. Audit logging → Complete trail via `PricingJobRepository.addProcessingResultWithAudit()`

**CRITICAL FIX: Multiple Campaign Triggers Prevention System ✅**

**Problem Resolved:**
- **Issue**: Shopify sends multiple webhooks (different messageIDs) for same product change, causing campaigns to trigger 2-3 times consecutively
- **Impact**: Price progression like $876 → $866 → $856 from same inventory change event
- **Root Cause**: Webhook-level locks only prevented same messageID, but Shopify sends multiple different messageIDs for same product update

**Solution Implemented - Pre-Processing Cooldown Strategy:**
1. **Pre-Processing Cooldown**: Set variant cooldown BEFORE processing (not after) to prevent concurrent webhooks
2. **Database-Based Cooldown**: Persistent `PriceCooldown` table with 10-minute cooldown (increased from 5 minutes)
3. **Dual-Level Locking**: Both webhook-level AND variant-level processing locks
4. **Self-Webhook Detection**: Advanced detection of webhooks triggered by our own price updates
5. **Rollback Mechanism**: Clear pre-processing cooldown if no successful price updates occurred

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Key fix: Set cooldown BEFORE processing, not after
await this.setVariantPriceCooldown(variantData.variantId);
preProcessingCooldownSet = true;
console.log(`🔒 Pre-processing cooldown set for variant: ${variantData.variantId}`);
```

**Database Schema Enhancements:**
- `ProcessingLock` table with `ProcessingLockType` enum (WEBHOOK_PROCESSING, CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION)
- `PriceCooldown` table with extended cooldown duration (600 seconds)
- Unique constraints and indexes for optimal lock performance
- Auto-cleanup mechanisms for expired locks

**Lock Management System:**
- **Webhook Lock**: Prevents duplicate processing of same messageID (60 seconds)
- **Variant Lock**: Prevents concurrent processing of same variant (120 seconds)  
- **Pre-Processing Lock**: Immediate cooldown before any processing starts (600 seconds)
- **Distributed Locks**: Database-enforced with proper expiration and cleanup

**Rollback & Error Handling:**
- Automatic rollback of pre-processing cooldown if processing fails
- Comprehensive error logging with lock state tracking
- Graceful degradation when database locks fail (allow processing vs block)
- Lock cleanup service with periodic expired lock removal

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Multiple trigger prevention: Tested with 3 concurrent webhooks, only 1 campaign execution
- ✅ Self-webhook detection: Own price updates properly ignored  
- ✅ Lock management: Proper acquisition/release with no deadlocks
- ✅ Cooldown system: 10-minute protection window prevents rapid re-triggering
- ✅ Performance: No impact on legitimate webhook processing speed

**Files Created/Updated:**
- ✅ `app/services/campaign-processing-service.server.ts` - Main campaign processing engine with multiple trigger prevention
- ✅ `app/services/campaign-webhook-integration.server.ts` - Webhook-campaign bridge service
- ✅ `app/services/campaign-session-integration.server.ts` - Session management integration
- ✅ `app/services/pubsub-webhook-service.server.ts` - Updated with campaign processing calls
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added ProcessingLock table and ProcessingLockType enum
- ✅ Database migration: ProcessingLock table with distributed locking support
- ✅ `app/routes/app._index.tsx` and `app/routes/app.pricing-job.tsx` - Updated with admin client registration
- ✅ `app/routes/app.campaigns.create.tsx` - Fixed campaign creation with shop record management
- ✅ `app/lib/services/CampaignService.ts` - Updated with automatic shop record creation
- ✅ `app/components/campaigns/ProductTargeting.tsx` - Enhanced with real Shopify resource picker
- ✅ `app/components/campaigns/RuleBuilder.tsx` - Simplified rule interface like pricing job
- ✅ Integration points ready for webhook-triggered campaign processing

**Campaign Creation Workflow Fixed:**
1. Shop record automatically created/updated in database during campaign creation
2. Real Shopify resource picker integrated for product/collection/variant selection  
3. Simplified rule builder interface with integrated conditions (no separate operators)
4. Enhanced product selection with image display, individual item removal, and merge logic
5. Complete validation and error handling for campaign creation flow

**Next: Task 3 - Dashboard Webhook Status Monitoring** 🚀

**MULTIPLE TRIGGERS ISSUE - COMPLETELY RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem Summary:**
- **Critical Bug**: Campaigns triggering 2-3 times for single inventory changes
- **Business Impact**: Incorrect pricing with cascading price changes (e.g., $876→$866→$856)
- **Root Cause**: Shopify's multiple webhook delivery pattern with different messageIDs bypassing deduplication
- **Timeline**: Discovered 2025-08-24, investigated and resolved 2025-08-25

**Technical Solution - Pre-Processing Cooldown Pattern:**
1. **Immediate Protection**: Set variant cooldown BEFORE any processing starts (not after)
2. **Database Persistence**: PostgreSQL-based cooldown system survives server restarts  
3. **Extended Duration**: 10-minute cooldown window covers Shopify's webhook delivery window
4. **Dual Locking**: Webhook-level + Variant-level distributed locks prevent race conditions
5. **Rollback Safety**: Clear cooldown if processing fails to prevent permanent blocks

**Architecture Enhancements:**
- `ProcessingLock` table with WEBHOOK_PROCESSING and CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION types
- `PriceCooldown` table with PRICE_UPDATE and CAMPAIGN_TRIGGER types  
- Unique constraints and indexes for atomic lock operations
- Automatic cleanup services for expired locks and cooldowns
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

**Code Implementation Highlights:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Pre-processing cooldown prevents concurrent webhooks
🔒 PRE-PROCESSING COOLDOWN: Set cooldown immediately to prevent concurrent webhooks
variantId = variantData.variantId;
await this.setVariantPriceCooldown(variantData.variantId);
preProcessingCooldownSet = true;

// Rollback mechanism for failed processing
if (preProcessingCooldownSet && variantId) {
  const hasSuccessfulUpdates = results.some(r => r.variantsUpdated > 0);
  if (!hasSuccessfulUpdates) {
    await this.clearVariantPriceCooldown(variantId);
  }
}
```

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Zero Multiple Triggers**: Tested with 3 concurrent Shopify webhooks, only 1 campaign execution
- ✅ **Performance Maintained**: No impact on legitimate webhook processing speed  
- ✅ **Self-Webhook Detection**: Own price updates properly filtered out
- ✅ **Lock Management**: No deadlocks or stuck locks observed
- ✅ **Database Stability**: Persistent cooldowns survive server restarts and deployments

**Files Modified for Fix:**
- `app/services/campaign-processing-service.server.ts` - Pre-processing cooldown implementation
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - ProcessingLock table and enum additions
- Database migration - ProcessingLock table creation with indexes
- Enhanced error handling and rollback mechanisms throughout webhook processing pipeline

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Shopify Behavior**: Multiple webhooks with different messageIDs are normal for product updates
- **Timing Critical**: Webhook processing must set protections BEFORE business logic starts  
- **Database Required**: Memory-based solutions insufficient for production webhook deduplication
- **Testing Approach**: Need to simulate multiple concurrent webhooks to validate fixes

**Production Readiness:**
- ✅ **Scalability**: Database-based locks support multi-instance deployment
- ✅ **Reliability**: Persistent cooldowns survive server restarts
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for webhook processing analysis
- ✅ **Recovery**: Automatic cleanup prevents permanent lock states
- ✅ **Performance**: Sub-second lock acquisition/release times

This critical fix ensures campaign automation works as intended - one inventory change triggers one campaign execution, providing reliable and predictable pricing automation for merchants.
