# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Epic with Phased Story Implementation** 

**Rationale**: Your brownfield enhancement involves tightly coupled components (webhook processing, campaign management, database migration, audit trails) that need coordinated development. Multiple epics would create artificial boundaries and increase integration risk. A single epic with carefully sequenced stories allows for incremental risk management, consistent architecture evolution, and comprehensive testing continuity.

### Navigation Architecture
```
├── Home (Dashboard) - Shows active campaigns, recent pricing jobs, system status
├── Create Pricing Job - Enhanced version of current admin.tsx (immediate execution)
└── Create Campaigns - Automated campaign management with tracking
```
