# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
- Document-project output available at: `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
- Comprehensive business context at: `docs/shopify-bulk-price-app-summary.md`
- IDE-based project loaded with full codebase access

### Current Project State
Based on existing analysis: Single-page Shopify app with two primary functions:
1. Simple bulk price increases ($10 to all selected variants)
2. Advanced inventory-based conditional pricing rules

The app uses Remix framework with Shopify App Bridge, Polaris v12 design system, and SQLite session storage. Main business logic concentrated in `app.admin.tsx` with known technical debt including unused template code and single-route architecture.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- ☑ Major Feature Modification - Real-time automation with webhooks
- ☑ New Feature Addition - Campaign management system  
- ☑ Integration with New Systems - Webhook-based real-time processing
- ☑ UI/UX Overhaul - Multi-page navigation structure
- ☑ Technology Stack Upgrade - Architecture refactoring from single-file to modular

**Enhancement Description:**
Transform the current manual admin-based pricing tool into a real-time automated campaign system that responds to inventory changes via webhooks, while refactoring the single-file architecture into a proper multi-page navigation structure for scalability.

**Impact Assessment:**
- ☑ Major Impact (architectural changes required) - Moving from single-file to multi-page architecture, adding webhook infrastructure, implementing real-time automation

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
• Enable real-time price adjustments based on inventory changes without manual intervention
• Create campaign management system for scheduled/automated pricing rules
• Refactor single-file architecture into maintainable multi-page structure
• Implement webhook infrastructure for real-time inventory monitoring
• Maintain all existing functionality during transition
• Follow first principles approach with smallest possible incremental changes

**Background Context:**
The app evolved organically from simple manual price changes to complex inventory-based rules, all concentrated in a single admin.tsx file. Initial attempts at user self-service failed, leading to the current centralized admin approach for testing. Now ready to scale to real-time automation but requires architectural foundation and webhook integration. The existing working functionality must be preserved while transitioning to a more scalable architecture.

**Enhanced Requirements with Competitive Insights:**
- **30-60 second response time** (acceptable given Shopify API limits and competitive analysis)
- **Comprehensive audit trail** for sensitive pricing decisions
- **Campaign management dashboard** with real-time status monitoring
- **Complete pricing history** with rollback capabilities
- **High-volume order handling** during peak periods (30-50 orders/hour)
- **Robust database design** for future expansion scenarios

**Key Market Differentiators Identified:**
- **Transparent audit trails** (competitors are "black boxes")
- **Campaign testing/staging capabilities** (market gap)
- **Granular rollback functionality** (rare in market)
- **Real-time campaign monitoring** (most competitors lack visibility)
