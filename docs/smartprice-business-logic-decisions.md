## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **Key Business Logic Decisions**
1. **‚úÖ Single Rule Evaluation** - Most specific rule wins, no stacking
2. **‚úÖ Campaign Product Isolation** - Phase 1: No overlapping, Phase 2: Priority system
3. **‚úÖ Optional Bidirectional Pricing** - Merchant choice per campaign
4. **‚úÖ Soft Delete Only** - ARCHIVED status preserves audit trail
5. **‚úÖ Progressive UX** - Basic/Advanced mode toggle

### **Technical Alignment Status**
**üü¢ EXCELLENT ALIGNMENT**: All major decisions already implemented by James!
- Rule prioritization: ‚úÖ `prioritizeRules()` method implemented
- Multiple trigger prevention: ‚úÖ Pre-processing cooldown system working  
- Soft delete: ‚úÖ ARCHIVED status integrated
- Performance: ‚úÖ Database-based locking system operational

## üìã **DETAILED BUSINESS LOGIC SPECIFICATIONS**

### **1. Campaign Rule Processing Logic**

#### **Decision: Most Specific Rule Wins**
```yaml
Rule_Processing:
  approach: "single_rule_evaluation"
  logic: "most_specific_condition_wins"  
  stacking: false
  
  example:
    inventory: 18
    rules: 
      - "inventory < 25 ‚Üí +$100"
      - "inventory < 20 ‚Üí +$100"  
    result: "Only < 20 rule triggers (most specific)"
```

#### **Technical Implementation Status**
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: `prioritizeRules()` method in `CampaignProcessingService`
- ‚úÖ **VALIDATED**: Test cases confirm proper rule selection logic
- ‚úÖ **PERFORMANCE**: Sub-second rule evaluation with intelligent prioritization

#### **Business Rationale**
- **Red Team Analysis**: Prevented price explosion scenarios ($200+ jumps)
- **Stakeholder Consensus**: Customer predictability + merchant understanding
- **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates complex compound pricing edge cases

---

### **2. Campaign Product Overlap Management**

#### **Decision: Phased Approach**
```yaml
Product_Overlap:
  phase_1: "strict_isolation"     # No overlapping products
  phase_2: "priority_system"     # Merchant-controlled priorities
  
  error_handling:
    message: "Product [Name] already in Campaign [Name]"
    options: ["Cancel", "Move to New Campaign"]
```

#### **Implementation Plan**
- üîÑ **PHASE 1**: Story 1.6 - Campaign Product Overlap Prevention
- üìÖ **PHASE 2**: Future story - Campaign Priority System
- ‚úÖ **FOUNDATION**: CampaignService architecture supports both approaches

#### **Business Rationale**
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Start simple, add complexity based on merchant needs
- **Developer Preference**: Manageable implementation complexity
- **Merchant Learning**: Progressive feature adoption curve

---

### **3. Price Recovery (Bidirectional Pricing)**

#### **Decision: Merchant Choice**
```yaml
Bidirectional_Pricing:
  availability: "optional_per_campaign"
  default: "manual_recovery"
  merchant_control: true
  
  example:
    increase_rule: "inventory < 25 ‚Üí +$100"
    recovery_rule: "inventory > 30 ‚Üí -$100" (optional)
    hysteresis: "5_unit_buffer" # Prevents ping-pong
```

#### **Implementation Status**
- üìÖ **PLANNED**: Phase 2 feature after core functionality validated
- ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE**: Current system supports bidirectional rules
- üîÑ **UX DESIGN**: Requires toggle in Advanced mode

#### **Business Rationale**
- **Customer Stakeholder**: Emphasized fairness and price recovery
- **Technical Complexity**: Optional implementation reduces V1 risk
- **Merchant Choice**: Flexibility for different business models

---

### **4. Campaign Deletion Policy**

#### **Decision: Soft Delete Only**
```yaml
Deletion_Policy:
  approach: "soft_delete_only"
  status: "ARCHIVED"
  data_preservation: true
  
  behavior:
    ui_display: false         # Excluded from active campaign queries
    audit_trail: preserved    # Complete historical data maintained
    analytics: available      # Business intelligence data intact
```

#### **Implementation Status**
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: ARCHIVED status working in CampaignService
- ‚úÖ **UI INTEGRATION**: Campaign cards show delete as archive
- ‚úÖ **QUERY OPTIMIZATION**: Active campaigns exclude ARCHIVED automatically

#### **Business Rationale**
- **Business Analyst**: Historical data essential for optimization
- **Compliance**: Audit trail requirements for pricing decisions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents accidental data loss scenarios

---

### **5. User Experience Complexity Management**

#### **Decision: Basic/Advanced Mode Toggle**
```yaml
UX_Progressive_Disclosure:
  modes: ["Basic", "Advanced"]
  default: "Basic"
  target_split: "80/20"    # 80% basic users, 20% power users
  
  basic_mode:
    - campaign_name_description
    - single_rule_builder
    - simple_product_selection
    - essential_validation
    
  advanced_mode:
    - multiple_rules
    - complex_targeting
    - advanced_options
    - comprehensive_validation
```

#### **Implementation Plan**
- üìÖ **PLANNED**: Story 1.7 - Basic/Advanced Mode Toggle
- üéØ **UX GOAL**: Reduce cognitive load for 80% of merchants
- ‚ö° **TECHNICAL**: React state management for mode switching

#### **Business Rationale**
- **Merchant Diversity**: Different complexity needs (simple stores vs enterprise)
- **Onboarding**: Basic mode serves as guided learning path
- **Feature Adoption**: Progressive revelation based on user confidence
