# Monitoring and Observability

The monitoring strategy provides comprehensive visibility into campaign automation performance, webhook processing reliability, and system health on your dedicated server infrastructure.

### Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Browser performance metrics via Web Vitals API + custom dashboard analytics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Winston structured logging + PostgreSQL metrics logging + Node.js performance monitoring
- **Error Tracking:** Custom error aggregation in PostgreSQL + email/Slack alerting for critical issues
- **Performance Monitoring:** Application response times + database query performance + Redis queue metrics

### Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for Shopify admin embedding performance
- JavaScript errors and unhandled promise rejections
- API response times from frontend perspective
- User interactions (campaign creations, pricing job submissions)

**Backend Metrics:**
- Request rate and response time distribution (95th percentile target: <200ms)
- Error rate by endpoint and error type (target: <1% error rate)
- Database query performance (slow query threshold: >100ms)
- Webhook processing time (target: <60 seconds end-to-end)

**Business Metrics:**
- Campaign execution success rate
- Pricing job completion rate
- Webhook processing success rate
- Audit trail completeness

**System Metrics:**
- Server resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) on your 16GB server
- PostgreSQL connection pool usage
- Redis memory usage and queue lengths
- Docker container health and restart frequency
