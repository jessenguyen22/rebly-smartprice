# Security and Performance

The security and performance strategy addresses both frontend user experience and backend reliability requirements, optimized for your dedicated server infrastructure and Shopify app compliance.

### Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self' *.shopifycdn.com *.shopify.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *.shopify.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *.shopifycdn.com`
- XSS Prevention: React's built-in XSS protection + input sanitization for all user content
- Secure Storage: Shopify session tokens in httpOnly cookies, no sensitive data in localStorage

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Joi schema validation for all API endpoints with strict type checking
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP for API endpoints, 10 requests/minute for webhook processing
- CORS Policy: `https://*.shopify.com, https://admin.shopify.com` with credentials support

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Shopify session tokens in httpOnly, secure cookies with SameSite=Strict
- Session Management: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with 24-hour expiration and refresh rotation
- Password Policy: N/A - Shopify OAuth only, no password management required

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB initial JavaScript bundle with code splitting
- Loading Strategy: Route-based code splitting with preload hints for critical routes
- Caching Strategy: Service worker for static assets, stale-while-revalidate for API data

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for API endpoints, < 60 seconds for webhook processing
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling (max 20 connections), query result caching for 5 minutes
- Caching Strategy: Redis caching for campaign rules, product data cache with 1-hour TTL
